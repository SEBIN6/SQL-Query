E-Commerce Data Analysis with MySQL
Overview
This project demonstrates the use of SQL queries to extract and analyze data from an e-commerce database using MySQL. The objective is to showcase various SQL techniques, including SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, JOINs, subqueries, aggregate functions, views, and query optimization with indexes. The deliverables include a .sql file containing the queries and screenshots of the query outputs.

Dataset
The project uses an e-commerce dataset (e.g., E-Commerce Data from Kaggle) containing tables such as Customers, Orders, Products, and Categories. You can replace this with any e-commerce dataset of your choice, ensuring it supports relational queries.

Objectives
Write SQL queries to extract and analyze e-commerce data.
Demonstrate proficiency with SQL features: SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT), subqueries, aggregate functions (SUM, AVG), views, and indexes.
Save queries in a .sql file and provide screenshots of query outputs.
Tools
MySQL: For database management and query execution.
MySQL Client: MySQL Workbench or command-line interface for running queries.
Text Editor: For writing and saving the .sql file (e.g., VS Code, Notepad++).
